     Google's first page gets you lots of clients.
     Did you know that if your business website is not on the first page of Google in your city, you are lossing a great deal of potential clients/customers?

     Why is SEO so important?
     Google has algoryths to analyze your website in depth. Google analyzes the authoriy, credibility, and contect of your website including text, images, tags, links. Google also looks
     outside of your website for citations, backlinks, social links, and more. If your website is not  on the first page of Google in you city for the services/products you provide, then its time to optimize it.
